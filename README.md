This project serves as a tracker for meme stocks or highly volatile stocks I wish to stay updated with.
My theory is that we can often overlook some of the longer term performance of high volatility/high growth stocks due to the risky nature of the company or news. 
This project will track returns from a handful of these risky stocks to determine whether the trader "missed out" on any returns.
